# TSP_Algorithms
Traveling salesman problem algorithms in python.
In this project i implement and analyze the complexity of the following algorithms for the traveling salesman problem:

* Held-Karp's algorithm
* Nearest neighbor euristic
* 2-Approximation algorithm

The results can be found in report.pdf.
